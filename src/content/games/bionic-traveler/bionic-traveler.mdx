Bionic Traveler is the 2021-2022 school year project of the University of Pennsylvania Game Research and Development Environment Club (UPGRADE).

UPGRADE sought to use the development of this project to teach its members the processes of game development, to serve as an outlet for creative expression, and to provide the expression of bringing a game from concept all the way to market. Thus, the contents of this game were made over the course of a singular academic year at UPenn off of weekly meetings, a few extra-meeting crunches, and a hackathon.

The game was ultimately not entirely finished, but this build that is now listed on Steam serves to show off the work that the students in this club were able to accomplish on top of their rigorous course loads at UPenn.
