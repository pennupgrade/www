One Huge Pizza is a hack-n'-slash bullet hell! True to its name, battle it out on a giant cheese pizza filled with food-inspired monsters and their (delicious looking?!) spawns. Use your giant pizza cutter to mow through the enemies and dodge the neverending stream of bullets.

The game presented at the end of the game jam featured only one level, and there were a few bugs with the game. Forest worked on an expansion pack that contains the original game with bug fixes, as well as 5 remastered levels, including one new original rock song ("Only You Know"), new gameplay mechanics, and more challenges for experienced players.
