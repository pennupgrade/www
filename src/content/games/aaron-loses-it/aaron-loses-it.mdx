_"What's wrong? Aaron??? AARON!!!!!!"_

You play as Aaron, who has to switch between four lanes to gun down the evil candy monsters before they get to you! Lose all three hearts and you're out.

The theme for the jam was "TRICK" and we incorporated that into the monster spawning logic. They will sometimes switch lanes and predict where you're _not_ going to be, tricking you!

## Instructions

Switch lanes by using the right and left arrow keys. Z, X, C, V will fire the red, blue, green, and orange guns, respectively. Navigate to the correct lane and use the gun that matches the monster's color to kill them. Survive as long as possible.
