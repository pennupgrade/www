Take control of a duck and goose and help them climb to the top of the platforms. Drink the lemonade from the stand to get double jump. But don't let the two get too far from each other, otherwise you'll break their hearts and the game will end ðŸ’”

At its core, DuckGooseDuckGoose is a collaborative game. Play with another person, one using WASD keys, one on arrow keys.

But the twist is that they share the spacebar to jump! Frustration ensues -> It's a fun time :)
