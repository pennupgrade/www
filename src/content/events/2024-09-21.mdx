Oh no! Your Unity game is acting up, nothing is going right, and you have no idea where to go from here! Don't worry, Edward is here to save the day. Come to our dedicated debugging workshop and we'll help guide you through an example Unity project so that we can squash all the bugs together.

The team that solves the most bugs gets donuts!
