Join us for the first official UPGRADE meeting for the 24-25 school year! We'll go over some general announcements (new mem form, Godot side quest), do an icebreaker, and then introduce this semester's club game, PennBoy! If we have time at the end, we'll also begin setting up everyone's GitHub and start Viraj's Unity workshop.
