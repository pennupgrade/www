We're holding a game night fundraiser in collaboration with Penn Esports! It will be on Friday, April 26, from 7 - 11 PM, in the McNeil Building, room 309.

We'll be playing a number of games, including Jackbox, Gartic, HumanBenchmark, a Minecraft server, and more! Food and drinks will be provided.

_There is a $5 entry fee._ This is because **all proceedings will be donated** to AbleGamers, a charity that is helping people with disabilities play the same games as everyone else.

We hope to see you there!
