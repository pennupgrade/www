We hope everyone had a nice Fall Break. Our first meeting back will be **PENNBOY DEMO DAY**! This is the deadline for the minigame demos that you've been working on for the past month or so; time to present your work to the club, enjoy some free pizza and drinks, and _GET KNIGHTED TO OFFICIALLY BECOME A DEV!_

Afterwards we will also be hosting an optional karaoke celebration at [Ken's Seafood](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gfWawTxADMbqHF259). Please react to the message in the `#announcements` channel on Discord so we can get a rough headcount!
