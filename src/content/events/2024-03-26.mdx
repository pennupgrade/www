You'll get a chance to hear them talk about working in the game industry and some advice for us current students. This is especially cool given their own career trajectory.

Join us in person **from 7 to 9 PM EST** in **Levine 307** or you can join virtually via the Zoom link, which can be found in our Discord! See y'all there!
