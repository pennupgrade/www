Description taken from the [NSO website page](https://nso.upenn.edu/event/developing-video-games-for-fun-and-profit/):

_Hi, we're Penn's game dev club! We'll discuss what we do, our development process, and how you can (freely) join. We'll also demo a prototype of what we've been working on over the summer, and let people ask questions and try out our past games._
