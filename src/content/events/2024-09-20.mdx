Come out to support a fellow gaming-adjacent club and learn more about what Penn Esports does, their active rosters, and the professional esports industry and how game development (that's us!) fits in. **It will be in Tangen Hall, and please bring your PennCard as you'll need it to enter the building.**

Free pizza and drinks will be provided, and stay behind afterwards as people are bringing their consoles for a fun game night. See you there!
