UPGRADE is partially subsidizing the cost to send a few students to this year's [ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics](https://i3dsymposium.org/2024/index.html), or I3D for short (what a mouthful). Luckily for us it's being hosted by our good friends at Cesium this year, who are based out of Philly, so getting there is simply a SEPTA ride away :)

_You should have received a message from us if you filled out the interest form in the `#announcements` channel a few weeks ago._
