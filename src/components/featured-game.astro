      Under the leadership of Di Lu (SEAS '22) and Edward Zhang (SEAS + Wharton '23), UPGRADE sought
      to use the development of this project to teach its members the processes of game development,
      to serve as an outlet for creative expression, and to provide the expression of bringing a
      game from concept all the way to market. Thus, the contents of this game were made over the
      course of a singular academic year at UPenn off of weekly meetings, a few extra-meeting
      crunches, and a hackathon. The game was ultimately not entirely finished, but this build that
      is now listed on Steam serves to show off the work that the students in this club were able to
      accomplish on top of their rigorous course loads at UPenn.
